The red, green, and blue LEDs fade in and out one by one.

The buzzer is activated during the light show.

Components Needed

Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)

RGB LED

Buzzer

Resistors (for LED protection)

Jumper wires

Usage

Connect the components according to the schematic.

Upload the Arduino code from your_code_file.ino.
